# Project_Vision_Template
Our project aims to improve the daily lifes of all FEUP Students by updating the schedule to be more flexible to the needs of any specific individual.

Unlike Sigarra the schedule could be updated to add/remove classes or events depending on the student necessities.

This would make students with conflicting theoretical classes able to organize their schedule so that they don't have to be forced to miss a class, students that don't need/want to go to some classes able to hide them and students that have some extracurricular activities able to incorporate them into their schedule.
