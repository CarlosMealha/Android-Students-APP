# Timetable editor

## Vision Stament
Our project aims to improve the daily lifes of all FEUP Students by updating the schedule to be more flexible to the needs of any specific individual and sharing it easier.
Unlike Sigarra the schedule could be updated to add/remove classes or events depending on the student necessities.

## Main Features
 - Add events - add classes not in your default schedule or other extracurricular activities to better organize your week.
 - Remove events - remove events added previously or that were already in the main schedule.
 - Share your timetable - allow your friends to see your timetable, making appointments easier to schedule.

## Required API's
- Student timetable from sigarra
